# Traffic_Sign_Recoginition
This a project related to CNN. The application tries to recognize traffic signs on the bases of the all the training done to the model, by using the concept of convolutional neural networks.

I have cloned the repo.


We are going the use the .h5 file to load the model into our webapp, that is the .py file, attributed with the frontend files - html,css and javascript, accessing it from the folder named "static".

The .ipynb file is going to be offline, as the repositry will not be able to hold the dataset due to large size.
So, the training will be done here in my system and I'll be uploading the .py file along with the .h5 model file, to load the trained model in the application (WebApp).

In conclusion the .ipynb file is just for demonstration here; The training of the model is done in the server only.
